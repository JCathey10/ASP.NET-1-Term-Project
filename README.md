# SoccerFans
This is a soccer community site using ASP.NET Core 3.1

A community soccer fan site I built for the final of my Web Development 2: ASP.NET course at Lane Community College. Users can create an account, comment on popular videos, create forum posts for other users, comment on forum posts, as well as browse user profiles. The site has integrated roles for administrators and is using ASP.NET Identity for account management.
